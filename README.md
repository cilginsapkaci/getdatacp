Dear User,

This repo includes three files that are relevant to the production of the tidy data that was uploaded to the Getting Data course assignment page on Coursera.  The goal in this exercise was to create a tidy dataset using the UCI Human Activity Recognition data. I relied on the general consensus about "tidy data" in the course [tidy data thread](https://class.coursera.org/getdata-014/forum/thread?thread_id=31) to shape the data.

You will find in this repo:

1. **run/_analysis.R:** The R script you can run to create the tidy data.  The notes in the code are intended to help the user understand what each step of the code does.
2. **codebook.md:** A detailed description of the downloading the data, software used, necessary steps **before** running the script such as the working directory and folder to unzip the file.  It includes detailed descriptions of the steps taken in the script.  It aims at reproducibility of the code.
3. This **readme.md** file!
